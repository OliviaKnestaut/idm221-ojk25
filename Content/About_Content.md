## About Olivia

I am a User Experience & Interaction Design Student at Drexel University who is passionate about creativity, problem-solving, and making technology accessible to all. As a disabled student, one of my main goals is to get involved with the improvement of accessibility in media. I want to promote the consideration of a range of disabilities throughout every step of the process of technology development. Outside of my technology interests, I love crocheting and taking care of houseplants.

### Get In Touch

I am always looking for collaborations and project ideas. If you want to chat about design, books, plants, or anything else, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out.
